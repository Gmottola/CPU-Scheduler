# CPU-Scheduler
A series of programs that simulate the different types of CPU Scheduling methods
Each scheduling simulation uses hard coded numbers for a processes burst time (time spent in the CPU), arrival time (when the process arrives at the CPU), and their index (a way to describe each process). All of these are set up inside the Process class, and each process is defined in the scheduler.
